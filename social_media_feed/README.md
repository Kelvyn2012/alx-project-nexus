🧪 Challenges Faced & Solutions Implemented

1. Understanding complex backend architecture

Challenge: Transitioning from basic CRUD to scalable architecture.
Solution: Broke systems into smaller components: services, serializers, business logic layers, and reusable modules.

2. Debugging API validation & query issues

Challenge: Handling nested data and optimizing ORM queries.
Solution: Leveraged Django’s select_related, prefetch_related, and implemented proper schema validation.

3. Mastering Docker and containerized deployments

Challenge: Creating consistent development environments.
Solution: Built Dockerfiles, docker-compose setups, and automated builds.

4. Implementing CI/CD pipelines

Challenge: Ensuring code quality and auto-deployment.
Solution: Configured GitHub Actions for test automation, linting, and deploy triggers.

🧭 Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

Write clean, modular, and reusable code.

Always validate input at every layer (models, serializers, API level).

Use environment variables – never hardcode secrets.

Document APIs thoroughly (Swagger, Postman, GraphQL Playground).

Start small: build from MVP → refine → optimize.

Git commits should be meaningful and frequent.

Collaboration dramatically improves speed and code quality.

Ask questions early — don’t build in isolation.

🤝 Collaboration – Key to Success

Collaboration is a core part of the ProDev program.
